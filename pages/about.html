     <div id="birth">
            The YOYA-PC GAMES site was conceived when its creator saw the difficulties that gamers and other people 
            were constantly encountering when they wanted to play certain games, whether at home, in the metro, or 
            out and about. For example, you needed an appropriate operating system to be able to launch and play the
            game, you also needed your device to have a certain capacity, you also had to install certain 
            applications that the game required to be launched, and many other difficulties besides.
